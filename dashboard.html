                <br>

                <p>You want to find your family. Checking other major genealogical document database sites is not answering your questions. You want to know where to search next, but knowing the most effective record repositories isn't easy. </p>

                <br>

                <p>We've consolidated 15 separate repository searches to bring you a curated local search of where your ancestors lived. Find every courthouse, church, cemetery, government archive, church archive, school records, medical archives, historical and genealogical societies, and similar categories of repositories to know where to go next and to make your searches much faster. </p>
                <br>

                <p>Since we are a new site, we want to help make future searches better for you. Every repository is searchable and can be edited for the most up-to-date information. This includes descriptions of genealogical collections in case a collection is currently held in an area where the ancestors did not live. </p>

                <br>

                <p>Feel free to help in the efforts at Roots4All. Editing is a community activity, and if there are any specific repositories that you know about that are not yet listed, add them. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Our pilot program involves northern Chicago sites, and we look forward to adding more entries to share local genealogical repository knowledge across the world.</p>
